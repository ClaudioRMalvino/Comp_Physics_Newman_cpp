This repository will be utilized as a means of showing my scientific programming skills. 
I will be attempting to complete as many exercises from Mark Newman's textbook Computational Physics utilizing C++.
The textbook strictly covers Python language, which I have a seperate repository for, but will be attempting to complete the exercises as best as I can utilizing C++.
